# Audit Summary
The scripting used in this analysis could, with a few adjustments, be used more widely for election audits in the future. For example, some simple changes to the indexing and naming of objects could allow the script to be used on a general election level, with states taking the place of counties. Given the general election system in the US, the state with the most votes likely will not be interesting, but the turnout metrics will still be produced. These could be combined with similar datasets of older elections to analyze ongoing demographic trends in cruical states such as Florida. To say nothing of the general cycle application, this script could be used for similar elections with very little editing, assuming the data provided is in the same format.
